# Project & Developer support 

To improve tracking for project support we will be tracking projects centrally (rather than in each of the TechNERDs personal tracking). 

* **Project Name** = The name of the project/repo the developer is working for. Ideally add a link to their GH for the project where possible. 
* **Team Handles** = Handles of the invloved developers. If there is a clear team lead/developer lead please note that. 
* **Question Topics** = What topics are they asking questions about? High level, like the labels for the discussions. 
* **Discussion Links** = Links to each of the discussions the team has started. Add new discussions to the front of the list. 
  * `DD MMM YYYY: (supporting nerds handles) [Name of discussion thread](link to conversation, discord or GH);`
 
When projects ask new questions, add them to the front of the discussions list.
